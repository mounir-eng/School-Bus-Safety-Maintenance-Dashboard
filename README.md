appbus.py

The main Python script containing the Streamlit application code.

Features:

Data processing and feature engineering for OBD-II data.

Safety scoring system to evaluate driver behavior.

Predictive maintenance system to monitor vehicle health.

Interactive visualizations for safety scores, route analysis, and component health.

Maintenance recommendations with actionable steps.

enhanced_simulated_obd_data.csv

A simulated dataset containing OBD-II data for testing and demonstration purposes.

Columns include:

timestamp: Timestamp of the data recording.

speed: Vehicle speed in km/h.

rpm: Engine RPM.

engine_load: Engine load percentage.

lat: Latitude for geospatial analysis (optional).

lon: Longitude for geospatial analysis (optional).

Additional simulated metrics for testing the application.

Key Features of the Application:
Safety Analysis:

Calculates safety scores based on speeding, harsh braking, idling, and acceleration.

Detects anomalies in driving patterns using machine learning (Isolation Forest).

Predictive Maintenance:

Monitors engine stress, brake wear, and tire wear.

Predicts maintenance urgency using a Random Forest Classifier.

Provides detailed maintenance recommendations with actionable steps.

Interactive Dashboard:

Displays key metrics (safety score, maintenance urgency, engine stress, brake wear).

Visualizes safety scores over time, violation distribution, and component health trends.

Includes a map view for route analysis (if geospatial data is available).

User-Friendly Interface:

Built with Streamlit for easy deployment and interaction.

Custom CSS for enhanced visual appeal.
